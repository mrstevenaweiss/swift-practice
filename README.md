Portrait v Landscape
896 x 414 points in Portrait
414 x 896 in Landscape 

Changing color value of a pixel creates something visible
The more pixels, the more clear

1 point == 2 pixels
Devs work in points; Designers work in pixels

VIEW
anything that can be drawn on a screen
views can be a container
Types of "views" -- Button, Text, VStack, HStack

STATE 
can be very complex
SwiftUI is built to solve the state mismatch problem
It is done through Bindings. A particular Binding will always be associated with a particular state view

STRINGS
a sequence of characters.  interpolation \() (JS --> ${}  

VARIABLES & DATA TYPES
var variableName : Type (Bool, Double, etc) = InitialValue (an intial value) (@State is optional)
